# US-Debt Analysis
## Project Overview
This project explores the growth, patterns, and projections of the United States Total Public Debt Outstanding from 1993 to 2023. Using publicly available data, I performed exploratory data analysis, calculated key metrics like yearly percentage increases, identified seasonal trends, and forecasted debt growth. To enhance insights, I built pivot tables and visualizations to showcase important trends clearly.

## Objectives
* Analyze Year-over-Year (YoY) percentage increases in US Total Public Debt.
* Identify historical monthly patterns of debt growth.
* Forecast publicly held debt for the next five years using historical growth rates.
* Develop charts and pivot tables for easy interpretation of the data.
* Summarize findings and suggest areas for further research based on the analysis.

## Key Insights
**Yearly Debt Percentage Increase**
* From 2016–2019, the average yearly debt increase was around 5%.
* In 2020, a sharp spike occurred, likely driven by COVID-19 pandemic economic responses and stimulus measures.

**Historical Monthly Trends**
* Highest debt increases tend to happen during January, February, November, and December.
* Lowest debt increases are often observed during April, May, June, and July.
* Hypothesis:
    * Higher increases during holiday-heavy months (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year) may correlate with higher consumer spending and increased borrowing.
    * Lower increases during spring and early summer months due to fewer major holidays and reduced consumer debt activity.

**Projected Growth**
* 1997–2007: Debt increased by approximately $1 trillion.
* 2008–2019: Debt grew from $6 trillion to $17 trillion.
* 2020–2022: Debt rose sharply from $21.5 trillion to $25 trillion.
* Forecast for 2023–2027:
    * Projected to reach approximately $33 trillion.
    * Indicates a steady, continuous upward trend if current patterns hold.
